## About
I am an Infrastructure and Security Engineer managing fleets of Linux machines used to deploy machine testing at Lenovo. I lead defensive information security in the Test Engineering department, including the assesmement of vulnerabilities and mitigation of attacks, such as log4j and cryptojacking malware.

Out of work, I love to learn and play strategy games. I'm often on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/p/honeypotfly), playing with the rooms and working on Capture the Flags (CTFs). I also enjoy playing Chess, Minecraft, and League of Legends.
